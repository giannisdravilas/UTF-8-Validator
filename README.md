# UTF-8-validator

Provide some input and check whether it follows the UTF-8 encoding or not.
If so, the number of characters encoded using a single byte (ASCII encoding) is printed, as well as the number of characters using multiple bytes for their encoding. If a character not encoded in UTF-8 is included in the input, the program terminates and the above mentioned character is printed.
